Password Encrypt Before Database 

I built a simple local Wiki for my home server that contained passwords.

I wanted to encrypt them in the database, but I didn't want to use like an MD5 because I wanted to retreive them.

Its true that in my local machine...its UNLIKELY that anyone will get into it. And lets face it...The database isn't stored remotely, and if anyone got into my machine they would be able to find the code and then extract the passwords from the database.

But, like many projects...it sounded fun.

So I built my own cypher.

And this is it.
